# Fluent-Gmail
Fluent Gmail is a wrapper written in WPF for Gmail that allows you to enhance your experience by introducing Microsoft's Fluent design to the app. The project matches your system's native look and feel, with utilizing mica material. Also transfers some functionality from page to native app.
