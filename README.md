# Fluent-Gmail
Fluent Gmail is a wrapper written in WPF for Gmail that allows you to enhance your experience by introducing Microsoft's Fluent design to the app. The project matches your system's native look and feel, with utilizing mica material. Also transfers some functionality from page to native app.

Each feature in the project is called an integration. Integrations can fix styling and create or move functionality. Most of them are opt-out with a config file.

## Downloading
Get your latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/Segilmez06/Fluent-Gmail/releases/latest) page. Arm64 and x64 supported.

For most users, Windows x64 Standalone would work fine. See the table below to chose which one to use:
| Type       | Description |
| :--------- | :---------- |
| Standalone | All in one package. Contains it's own runtime.<br>Ready to use but bigger file size. |
| Framework  | Requires [.Net Core 9.0.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) to be installed. Much less file size.<br>Prefer this if you already have .Net Core installed. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I decided not to release x86 builds for this project due to the smaller user base and the architecture being mostly outdated.
> It can still be compiled from source if needed. If you are interested in an x86 builds, please create an issue.

## Installation
No installation required. Just download and extract the archive, then run it.
